# Capstone Comrades

> A team formation platform for the Capstone Project within KFUPM.

## Motivation

Capstone Comrades emerges from the new opportunity within KFUPM with regards to the senior year graduation project, that is the Capstone project. The capstone project consists of 2 courses, the first being the team formation course, followed by the implementation course. Our focus targets the team formation course, in which Capstone Comrades offers a wide variety of functionalities, including team formation, which assist the senior student into joining a group of other seniors that aligns perfectly with their goals and interests. We believe that Capstone Comrades will be of vital assistance to the senior year students within KFUPM, as it will eliminate vast issues and concerns over the team formation course of the newly Capstone project at KFUPM.
